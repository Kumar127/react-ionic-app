The twists require zero additional styling and will let your hair repair itself from damage sustained from heat, colouring and just the general wears and tears of life`

            It is the perfect combination of edgy yet pretty with just the right amount of masculinity to make it on trend.
            If you’re tired of the classic bob, try mixing thing up with this wavy style. 
            Bobs and waves are a match made in hair heaven.

It is the bad boy of hairstyles, we know we shouldn’t do it, but its allure is just too strong. With short hair, you may find yourself struggling to achieve the messy high bun. If so, go for the low option.  This may not be something you have thought of, but a low messy bun achieves the same level of simple styling as a high topknot while making your locks appear thicker too`

But the key to nailing short styles with thick hair is layers and texture. Avoid blunt cuts as this style will add bulk to your hair. Instead go for a layered, textured pixie cut. The layers will take some the weight out of your luscious locks allowing them to sit and flow with ease.`

Well, those dreaded days are over. A blunt cut is perfect for women with thin hair who still want to rock a shorter style. Not only are blunt cuts a great way to frame your face and accentuate your features, but they are also universally flattering, and very on trend.`

Simple and easy to style, bangs also require very little maintenance, other than the occasional trim. Bangs in short hair work particularly well as the frame your face, drawing attention to your features. This can also be a slimming style if you find your short hair is making you look a little fuller in the face.`
